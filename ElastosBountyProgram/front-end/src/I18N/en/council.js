            <li> Elastos is an open-sourced platform founded by the Elastos Foundation. As the project progresses and the community develops, the Elastos Foundation gradually brings community operations to community members and committees.</li>
            <li>Of the 33,000,000 ELA coins created in the Elastos Genesis Block, the Elastos Foundation chose to commit 16,500,000 coins towards development of the Elastos Ecosystem.

            <li>Every year, an additional 4% of the initial 33,000,000 ELA coins will be created, to ensure a healthy rate of coin supply inflation, incentivize network support, and to fund Cyber Republic projects.

            <li>The digital assets managed by the Elastos Foundation are limited to those NEO/ETH tokens raised during token sales, and the ELA allocated to the Elastos Foundation as described in the White Paper.</li>
