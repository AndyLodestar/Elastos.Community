# EBP (To Be Renamed) - Members Guide

As a member you can only apply to help organizers or take on bounties,
either developer or community based bounties.

## Developers

If you are a developer or aspiring engineer you are free to join any events or apply for tasks
in the developer page.

### Events


### Tasks

Anyone may apply to take on developer tasks but since there is a selection/acceptance process only a certain number
of applicants will be allowed for each task. After you apply for a task you must wait for the
admin/owner to either contact you or accept you.
